          <p class="text-muted lead text-start">Copyright (C) <a href="https://fsf.org/">2007 Free Software Foundation,
              Inc.</a>
            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
            of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&nbsp;</p>
          <h4 class="text-muted lead text-center">Preamble</h4>
          <p class="text-muted lead text-start">
            The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
            software and other kinds of works.

            The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
            to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
            the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
            share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
            software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
            GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
            any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
            your programs, too.

            When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
            price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
            have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
            them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
            want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
            free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

            To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
            these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
            certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
            you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

            For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
            gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
            freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
            or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
            know their rights.

            Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
            (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
            giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

            For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
            that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
            authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
            changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
            authors of previous versions.

            Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
            modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
            can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
            protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic
            pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
            use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we
            have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
            products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
            stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
            of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

            Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
            States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
            software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
            avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
            make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
            patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

            The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
            modification follow.</p>
          <h4 class="text-muted lead text-center">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>
          <p class="text-muted lead text-start">
            the above requirements apply either way.

            8. Termination.

            You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
            provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
            modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
            this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
            paragraph of section 11).

            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
            finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
            holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
            prior to 60 days after the cessation.

            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
            violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
            received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
            copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
            your receipt of the notice.

            Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
            licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
            this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
            reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
            material under section 10.

            9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

            You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
            run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
            occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
            to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
            nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
            modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
            not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
            covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

            10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

            Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
            receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
            propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
            for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

            An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
            organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
            organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
            work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
            licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
            the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
            not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
            rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
            (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
            any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
            sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

            11. Patents.

            A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
            License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
            work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

            A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
            owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
            hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
            by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
            but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
            consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
            purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
            patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
            this License.

            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
            patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
            make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
            propagate the contents of its contributor version.

            In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
            agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
            (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
            sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
            party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
            patent against the party.

            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
            publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
            then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
            available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
            patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
            consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
            license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have
            actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
            covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
            in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
            country that you have reason to believe are valid.

            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
            covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
            receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
            or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
            you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
            work and works based on it.

            A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
            the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
            conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
            specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered
            work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
            in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
            to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
            any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
            otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

            12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

            If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
            otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
            excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
            covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
            License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
            not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
            to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
            the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
            License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

            13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
            permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
            under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
            combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
            License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
            but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
            section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
            combination as such.

            14. Revised Versions of this License.

            The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
            the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
            be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
            address new problems or concerns.

            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
            Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
            option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
            version or of any later version published by the Free Software
            Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the
            GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
            by the Free Software Foundation.

            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
            public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
            to choose that version for the Program.

            Later license versions may give you additional or different
            permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
            author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
            later version.

            15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

            THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
            APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
            HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
            OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
            THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
            PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
            IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
            ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

            16. Limitation of Liability.

            IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
            WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
            THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
            GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
            USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
            DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
            PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
            EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
            SUCH DAMAGES.

            17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

            If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
            above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
            reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
            an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
            Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
            copy of the Program in return for a fee.
